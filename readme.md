## Description

Minimal Blog is an ongoing full stack blog app:

- Decoupled Design for the frontend and backend
- Created using SvelteKit, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, TypeScript, JavaScript, Vite, and JWT for authentication
- A fusion of a Single Page Application (SPA) and a Multi-Page Application (MPA), providing an optimal user experience
- Maintains the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR)

The motivation behind using both SvelteKit and Django is to:

- Overcome the limitations of other frameworks and libraries
- Retain MPA functionality, which would be lost with Svelte alone
- Avoid complexities in managing state between pages, as encountered with the Astro framework and its SSR implementation
